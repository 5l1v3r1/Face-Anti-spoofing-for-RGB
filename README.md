# An Face Anti-spoofing Method for Print and Video Attacks
### Only 15ms (cpu)!!
This method can overcome the generalization problem between different cameras. 

You don't need to repeat the training model anymore. Free your hands!!

**You can look at our demo and try it on your own.**

The demo's model only use 20 thousand to train and Face Detection using OpenCV Haar Cascades.So it has a great room for improvement!

**TO DO**

1.use more data to train the model

2.use FeatherNetB to train
